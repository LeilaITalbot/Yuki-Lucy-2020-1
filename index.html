            <p>Yuki has been trying his best to be a good boy and learn from his big sister.  He loves to play and cuddle with his penguin plushie.  He also loves to give kisses to everyone and his favorite place to be pet is on his belly.  He gets very excited and jumps around to tell everyone any time somebody comes home.</p>

            <p>Lucy has been a good girl for seven years and knows lots of cool tricks like high five. She enjoys sleeping and keeping Yuki in line. Her favorite spot is the belly or behind the ears and she'll paw you if she wants to be pet or if she wants to play. She always expects two walks a day, rain or shine.</p>
